*****PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE USED*****
 To develop this project I have used 
Microsoft visual basic 6.0 . Visual basic is a hidh
level programming language evolved from the 
earlier DOS Version called BASIC.BASIC means 
Beginner’s All-Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code. 
It is a Fairly easy programming language to learn. 
Different software companies produce different 
version of BASIC, such as Microsoft QBASIC, 
QUICKBASIC, OWBASIC, and so on.
 VISUAL BASIC is a Visual and event 
driven programming language. These are the main 
difference from the old BASIC, programming is 
done in a graphical environment. Therefore, a
VISUAL BASIC programming is made up of many 
subprograms, each has its own way of another.
 Programs created with Visual basic can be 
designed to run on windows, on the Web, within 
office application , or on mobile devices. Visual 
Studio, the most comprehensive VB development 
16
environment, or IDE , can be used to create 
program for all these mediums. Visual Studio .NET 
provides development tools to create programs 
based on the .NET framework, such as ASP.NET 
application , which are often deployed on the 
Web. Finally, Visual Basic is available as a 
streamlined application that is used primarily by 
beginning developers and for educational 
purposes
